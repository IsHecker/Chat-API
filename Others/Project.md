# Chat API Project: Real-Time Messaging

-----

## Project Description

The **"Chat API"** project aims to develop a comprehensive **real-time messaging API** that enables users to communicate instantly. This API will support essential features such as **user registration**, **friend management**, **one-on-one messaging**, and **group chats**. It will serve as the foundational backend for various chat applications, ensuring seamless and interactive communication experiences.

In today's digital age, real-time communication is crucial for both personal and professional interactions. This project focuses on building a robust API that handles all necessary functionalities for a modern chat application.

## Key Features & User Interactions

Here's a detailed look at how users will interact with the application powered by this API:

### User Registration and Authentication

  * **Sign Up**: New users can easily create an account by providing a unique **username**, **email**, and **password**. Account verification will be done via a confirmation email.
  * **Login**: Registered users can securely log in using their **email** and **password**. For enhanced security, **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** will be supported.

### Friend Management

  * **Add Friends**: Users can send **friend requests** to others. Once accepted, they can view each otherâ€™s **online status** and initiate chats.
  * **Remove Friends**: Users have the flexibility to remove friends from their list, which will also conclude any ongoing conversations with them.

### One-on-One Messaging

  * **Send and Receive Messages**: Users can exchange **text messages, images, and files** with their friends in real-time. The API will support **delivery receipts** and **read receipts** for reliable communication.
  * **View Chat History**: Users can access and review their entire conversation history, including all sent and received messages.

### Group Chats

  * **Create Group Chats**: Users can easily create group conversations by adding multiple friends. They can **name the group** and set a **group picture**.
  * **Manage Group Chats**: Group creators and administrators can **add or remove members**, **change the group name**, and **update the group picture**. All members will instantly see these updates.
  * **Send and Receive Messages in Groups**: Members can communicate effectively within group chats, with features like **replying to specific messages** and **mentioning other users**.

### Real-Time Notifications

  * **Message Notifications**: Users will receive instant **notifications for new messages**, applicable to both one-on-one and group chats.
  * **Friend Request Notifications**: Users will be notified of **incoming friend requests** and when their **sent requests are accepted**.

## Real-World Example

Imagine **Emma**, who relies on a chat application to stay connected with her friends and coordinate group projects.

Emma begins by signing up for an account using her email and a secure password. After logging in, she builds her contact list by sending **friend requests** to her peers.

She initiates a **one-on-one conversation** with her friend John, sharing updates and exchanging images. Thanks to the real-time messaging capabilities, their messages appear instantly for both of them. Emma also creates a **group chat** for her study group, adding multiple friends. This group becomes their central hub for sharing resources, discussing assignments, and planning meetings.

Crucially, whenever Emma receives a new message or a friend request, she gets a **real-time notification**, ensuring she remains fully updated on all interactions.

### 8\. API Endpoints (Optimized Design)

#### User Management

  * **`POST /users`**: Register a new user.
      * **Reasoning**: More RESTful to create a resource (`user`) under its collection (`/users`). Previously `/signup`.
      * **Request Body Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "username": "newuser",
          "email": "newuser@example.com",
          "password": "securepassword123"
        }
        ```
      * **Successful Response Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "message": "User registered successfully. Please check your email for verification.",
          "userId": "uuid-1234-abcd"
        }
        ```
  * **`POST /auth/login`**: Authenticate a user.
      * **Reasoning**: Grouping authentication-related actions under `/auth` is a common pattern. Previously `/login`.
      * **Request Body Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "email": "user@example.com",
          "password": "securepassword123"
        }
        ```
      * **Successful Response Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Login successful",
          "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
          "userId": "uuid-abcd-5678"
        }
        ```
  * **`GET /users/me`**: Get current authenticated user's profile details.
      * **Reasoning**: Explicitly refers to the authenticated user's profile, consistent with other resources being `/users/{id}`. Previously `/profile`.
      * **Successful Response Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "userId": "uuid-abcd-5678",
          "username": "CurrentUserName",
          "email": "user@example.com",
          "status": "online",
          "profilePictureUrl": "http://example.com/profile/currentuser.jpg"
        }
        ```
  * **`PATCH /users/me`**: Update current authenticated user's profile.
      * **Reasoning**: `PATCH` is preferred over `PUT` for partial updates, which is typical for profile changes (e.g., changing only username, not email/password). If the entire resource *must* be replaced, `PUT` is fine.
      * **Request Body Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "username": "UpdatedUserName",
          "profilePictureUrl": "http://example.com/profile/updateduser.jpg"
        }
        ```
      * **Successful Response Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Profile updated successfully",
          "userId": "uuid-abcd-5678"
        }
        ```

#### Friend Management

  * **`POST /friend-requests`**: Send a friend request.
      * **Reasoning**: Treats friend requests as a distinct resource. This allows for clear "create," "accept," and "reject" actions. Previously `/friends/add`.
      * **Request Body Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "recipientUserId": "uuid-efgh-9012"
        }
        ```
      * **Successful Response Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Friend request sent successfully",
          "requestId": "req-1234"
        }
        ```
  * **`PATCH /friend-requests/{requestId}`**: Accept or reject a friend request.
      * **Reasoning**: Using `PATCH` on the `friend-request` resource to update its status (e.g., to 'accepted' or 'rejected').
      * **Request Body Example (Accept):**
        ```json
        {
          "status": "accepted"
        }
        ```
      * **Request Body Example (Reject):**
        ```json
        {
          "status": "rejected"
        }
        ```
      * **Successful Response Example (Accept):**
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Friend request accepted",
          "friendshipId": "fs-5678"
        }
        ```
      * **Successful Response Example (Reject):**
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Friend request rejected"
        }
        ```
  * **`GET /users/me/friends`**: List current user's friends.
      * **Reasoning**: A common pattern for listing associated resources.
      * **Successful Response Example:**
        ```json
        [
          {
            "userId": "uuid-efgh-9012",
            "username": "JohnDoe",
            "status": "online",
            "lastSeen": "2024-07-12T09:00:00Z"

            "status": "offline",
            "lastSeen": "2024-07-11T18:00:00Z"
          }
        ]
        ```
  * **`DELETE /users/me/friends/{friendId}`**: Remove a friend.
      * **Reasoning**: Standard RESTful way to delete a specific resource. Previously `/friends/remove`.
      * **Path Parameter**: `friendId` (ID of the friend to remove)
      * **Successful Response Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "message": "Friend removed successfully"
        }
        ```

#### Messaging & Conversations

        {
          "recipientType": "user",

        [
          {
            "conversationId": "conv-1234-5678",
            "type": "one-on-one",
